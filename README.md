# crappyassert ðŸ’©

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/skellock/crappyassert.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/skellock/crappyassert)

A [`nim`](https://nim-lang.org) package which wraps `doAssert` so it prints nicer errors.

# What is this nonsense?

I like `doAssert`, but I sure wish it was easier to read.

# Installing

`nimble install https://github.com/skellock/crappyassert`

# Usage

```nim
import crappyassert

true === false  # calls `doAssert true == false`
```

# Why Not?

* custom operators suck?
* nobody likes more dependencies?
* you don't use `doAssert`
* you use anything other than `==` when calling `doAssert`

# Changelog

# Installing
